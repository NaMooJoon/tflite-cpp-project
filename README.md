# TensorFlow Lite C++ Application

This project is a comprehensive C++ application designed to leverage TensorFlow Lite for executing machine learning models in the `.tflite` format. The application reads and processes `.tflite` models, applying them in a C++ environment to perform various AI tasks, making it suitable for embedded systems and performance-critical applications.

## Overview

The application is built to interface seamlessly with TensorFlow Lite, utilizing its powerful capabilities for optimized inference on limited-resource environments, such as embedded systems. This project is designed to be adaptable and efficient, offering users the capability to deploy and manage TensorFlow Lite models in a C++ project environment, thus enhancing versatility and performance for on-device machine learning applications.

Key functionalities include:

- **Model Loading**: The application reads `.tflite` model files, preparing them for inference by setting up the model interpreter, allocating tensors, and initializing other necessary components.
- **Optimized Inference**: TensorFlow Lite provides various optimizations, including support for GPU and hardware-accelerated inference, enhancing the performance on resource-limited devices.
- **Ease of Integration**: The project is modular, allowing easy integration with other C++ components or pipelines, making it suitable for applications that require efficient, on-device processing.

## Features

- **Efficient Model Handling**: Automatically loads `.tflite` models, sets up interpreters, and manages tensor allocation for optimized performance.
- **High Performance**: Built with TensorFlow Liteâ€™s core features, this project can run models efficiently on ARM architectures with additional support for GPU (if available).
- **Customizable and Extensible**: With an organized structure, this project can be extended to support various use cases by implementing additional preprocessing or post-processing steps in C++.
- **Hardware Support**: The project configuration enables leveraging specific hardware acceleration options provided by TensorFlow Lite, such as **GPU**, **NEON**, or **VXDelegate**, which can be specified during the build.
